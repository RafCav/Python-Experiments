interface to create and edit videos based on data provided in a 
Google Sheets spreadsheet. By using libraries such as pyautogui 
and pyperclip, the script simulates mouse movements and clicks, 
as well as copying and pasting text, to automatically fill 
specific templates in Canva.

Fills in titles, subtitles, questions, and answer options in a 
video template on Canva.

based on the answers provided.
* **Google Sheets Integration:** Imports data directly from a 
Google Sheets spreadsheet to feed the video creation process.


## Requirements
Before running the script, make sure to have the following Python 
packages installed:
* `pandas`
* `pyautogui`
